# Oligo Code Scanner

Scanning your project on each pull request can help you keep vulnerabilities out of your project.

This GitHub Action uses [OSV Scanner](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/) to compare a vulnerability scan of the target branch to a vulnerability scan of the feature branch, and will fail if there are new vulnerabilities found which doesnâ€™t exist in the target branch.

You will be notified of any new vulnerabilities introduced through the feature branch. You can also choose to [prevent merging](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging) if new vulnerabilities are introduced through the feature branch.

## Usage

In your project repository, create a new file `.github/workflows/oligo-scanner-pr.yml` (Adding to an existing workflow file is also possible).

Include the following in the file:

    name: Oligo PR Scan

    # Change "main" to your default branch if you use a different name, i.e. "master"
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]
      merge_group:
        branches: [ main ]

    permissions:
      # Require writing security events to upload SARIF file to security tab
      security-events: write
      # Only need to read contents
      contents: read

    jobs:
      scan-pr:
        uses: "OligoCyberSecurity/oligo-code-scanner@v1.0.1"

Custom overrides and usage examples can be found in [OSV documentation](cloudposse/github-action-aws-region-reduction-map@0.2.1).

### Using Result Files

Results containing the new vulnerable packages will be logged out in the workflow run logs, but also may be viewed by clicking the output files in the [Artifacts section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts) of the the failed run screen.
